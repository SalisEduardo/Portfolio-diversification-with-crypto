##  **1. Literature Review**

In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous programmer, published the white paper of Bitcoin white paper, event that marks the genesis of the cryptocurrencies world.  This idea would only come to life after its release in January 3rd of 2009 , when the first unity was mined and the network launched. The purpose behind its creation was that people could transfer value digitally without any central intermediary, that only could be possible by the concept of blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database  (or a distributed ledger). Since than, Bitcoin still is the largest crypto by market capitalization, followed by more than 6000 new crypto currencies according to CoinMarkeCap. Over the last decade, that field evolved beyond its original concept of "a peer-to-peer electronic cash system" (*Nakamoto, 2008*) and became a gigantic market of more than 1 trillion dollars that started to be seen no only as a technological feature, but rather as an investment opportunity, leading to the emergence of a new asset class denominated as **Cryptoassets**.

According to *FINMA (qtd. in  Lieb,2022)*, Cryptoassets are one of the two subgroups of a broader category called Digital Assets,with another being composed of Security tokens. The first is composed of payment tokens (have no extra functionality than to be a mean of payment) and utility tokens (provide access  to applications or services), while the second one include asset tokens that represent another asset and entitle the holder to receive financial streams.
 
Through  euphoria and despair,  massive bullmarkets and bear markets, and any other kind of phase characteristic of a disruptive technology, those assets reached a critical  level of proportion that indicates that they are not any passing fad. As a new asset class with its unique characteristics, they not only attracted tech enthusiasts, but also the so called "smart money", composed of large investments institutions as hedge funds, endowments and renowned traders (*Houghan and Lawant, 2021*); representing a paradigm shift from its original conception as a speculative asset only. Despite that relevance, investors have a significant amount of challenges around that market that may include: lack of quality in information, small track record of trading, early stage financial theory about crypto's  valuation and portfolio composition, occurence of scams and malicious actors, uncertainties about regulation/taxation across regions, technical and competitive risks, etc.   

Regardless of its current size and stage of consolidation mentioned before, cryptocurrencies have been one of the focus of  the financial literature, which have attempted to understand the risks and benefits of investing in these alternative assets, as well as their potential effects. of diversification  Even with presence , the scope of research is still limited, either by focusing specifically on the reality of investors from developed countries, such as the United States and Europe, or by  only adopting Bitcoin (digital currency with the highest market capitalization) as a the crypto's representative. Also, with the rapid changes that happens in the macro scenario, many of those studies tend to be outdated. 

Platanakis and Urquhart (2020) analyze, under different criteria (time windows, transaction costs, risk aversion values, portfolio construction techniques) the effects of adding Bitcoin to a portfolio containing stocks and bonds (in the absense or presence of commodities), finding positive results out of the sample. 

Analyzing the joint dynamics between financial assets through time series models, Guesmi et al. (2018) also reach conclusions favorable to the use of Bitcoin in investment portfolios. The authors report that the currency can act as a hedge and bring diversification benefits to the traditional assets of the portfolio. 

For the Brazilian market, Colombo and Neto (2021) investigate the impact of adding a crypto baskets in a portfolio covering different classes of investment. The results indicated that the inclusion of digital currencies improved the performance metrics of the portfolios, even for different allocation methodologies and time windows of analysis. Similarly, Colombo et al (2020) finds that both global and emerging countries (including Brazil) investors can benefit from the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in portfolios composed of stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate.
